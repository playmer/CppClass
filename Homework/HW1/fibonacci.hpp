// The fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which a given index is the
// sum of the values of the previous two indicies. The first two starting
// values as we will define them, are 0 and 1.

// You will be writing a function that computes an index within the fibonacci
// sequence. Given 0 you will return 0, given 1, return 1, and given 3, return
// 3.
